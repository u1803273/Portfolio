I had to improve my controller further:
Explorer 1: Depth first search of a tree, including backtracking
Explorer 2: Had a refined memory, only storing necessary junctions that led to the goal
Explorer 3: Tackled mazes with a singe loop, and then multiple.
Grand Finale: Used a stack to store the path to the goal, so that in subsequent runs the controller
could navigate directly to the end node
